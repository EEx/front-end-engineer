# Senior Front End Web App Developer
#### 6-8 Week contract with possibility to hire.

Are you a seasoned web veteran that’s survived the browser wars?
Are you dedicated to developing full feature web applications with Javascript
and HTML5 for modern browsers? Do you have a passion for solid user experiences
and supporting the entire development life cycle of a digital product to
deliver that result?

We’re Efficiency Exchange (EEx) and we’re out to build the world’s best
energy management tool. We’re using the best, most accessible technology the
web has to offer and focusing on the very real needs of Chinese factories.
We want to work with a sharp front end developer like you. We are guided by a
set of principals that start with being user-oriented; we say “factory first”.
Our work is an outward expression of who we are and we strive to follow the
golden rule. We don’t ship software we wouldn’t want to use ourselves.

Above all you’re a team player and excellent communicator. Achieving
success as a team is more important than showing off and you’re happy
to jump in where needed, give advice and direction on tools and techniques,
and work with what’s available when there’s no time to rewrite something
in your preferred tool. You’ll work well with us because you are results
oriented.

_You should_

- Be ready to hit the ground running
- Hustle but not be sloppy
- Appreciate clean, unobtrusive, maintainable code

_You have_

 - A strong grasp of CSS & HTML5. Talking about the box model is not a
   foreign concept for you. Telling the team when to use section, aside,
   and div (and similar elements) is easy because you understand semantic
   markup.
 - An appreciation for CSS preprocessors but you don’t use them as a crutch.
   You can incorporate these tools into an existing pipeline or work without
   them.
 - Knowledge of fundamental Javascript patterns and practices. You loathe
   callback spaghetti and know how to keep event driven code organized.
 - An understanding of OO Javascript and reusable components. Other team
   members can add a div with a specific id to a page and your component
   will just work.
 - Experience with large projects, modular code, and dependency management.
   We’re using YUI’s loader but you also know about CommonJS.

_You will_

 - Use git and github to manage your code.
 - Peer review other code. (& have your code reviewed).
 - Comment & document your code.
 - Comment & document your code. (See previous)
 - Comment & document your code. (Really. We said it 3 times.)
 - Write code to existing standards (we’re flexible, but please,
   no comma-first notation).
 - Communicate specifications to the backend developer and collaborate on
   interface development.
 - Work when you’re most productive. Like to jam on code at 2am? No problem.
 - Not support IE (at least not at first).

We’re a Python shop building our product in Django. We love CoffeeScript
but we’re cool with plain ol’ JS, too. We’d love to meet you. Please send
us a link to your GitHub account, blog/twitter, and any live work examples.
Resumes are welcome but not required. Send the previous along with a note
introducing yourself to lee@efficiencyexchange.com or fork this repo, add
your information, and send us a pull request.
